media could loaded Using MX 3 Master without \"S\" issues like itBut one laud scroll sound Hate using ; When I first got mouse 6 months ago like flying space shuttle - I loved battery lasted days recharge Now I use hour two charging night Too bad swappable AA battery I could keep one charger For $100 worth fix basic issue bring back original mx master 3 least workedthis mouse frankenstein mx master 3 buttons silent buttons louder original mx3 buttons hard push useless 2 main buttons almost silentthe 2 side buttons silent little louder originalthe center scroll silentthe thumb button almost impossible press feedback know pressed I loved mouse little year later longer hold charge day without recharged prior several months usage When I contacted Logitech issue mouse said anything So keep mind It good year stay plugged usable With robust customization features mouse makes everything efficient work gaming browsing web For people might turned price hardcore enthusiast like must Would highly recommend adding desk Great product I enjoying use Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Mouse For \"regular mouse\" non gaming absolute best I ever used It little heavy FPS gaming work pinch For anything else head shoulders anything I used I used buy Logitech M510 wireless Mouse go bad 6 Months heavy MS Excel usage This 3S mouse may little big put briefcase backpack terms portability great desktop usage This little expensive yes I regretting purchase If use mouse professionally I think would regret purchase I using 2 4 Mhz USB dongle Bluetooth The battery charge lasts weeks Very pleased Month usage Had bad connection skipped missed lot I never thought I find mouse similar feel trusty old Logitech G403 excels every way This mouse performs every gesture lovely MacBook Pro trackpad greater precision ease use In fact far _more_ outstanding Apple trackpad For example \"hidden\" gesture button thumb naturally rests allows quickly zoom equivalent two-finger tap trackpad By holding button thumb move mouse toggle Mission Control App Exposé move mouse left right swipe desktops It even supports rotation Everything easily configurable using intuitive Logi Options+ app You also customize every button scroll per application; example Chrome use horizontal wheel move tabs The toggle button underneath scroll wheel switches infinite scrolling ratchet scrolling default But also software configurable My personal preference hold toggle button macOS quickly zooming use \"thumb\" button desktop gestures vice versa The material quality design top-notch The click \"feeling\" ultra-premium quiet I using Windows 11 macOS Ventura MacBook Pro M1 Max dual 4K monitors 120Hz 144Hz I used Flow option briefly It seemed little clunky understandable beta OS It certainly easier set Synergy On macOS beta I encountered latency initially external 4K monitor 144Hz The cursor would freeze temporarily Disabling handoff Settings resolved issue presumably macOS polling see iPad nearby mouse approaches edge screen There also latency using Bolt dongle Dell Thunderbolt 3 dock; moving USB dongle monitor side desk trick These typical Bluetooth issues improved Bolt Either way working flawlessly last month Windows macOS Ventura If software engineer work graphics CAD etc must-have Pros:Aside specs subtle aspects mouse make stand reset For instance magnetic wheel scroll makes really convenient scroll long pages Give quick roll roller disengage magnet scroll way end No annoying roller strokes The Options+ software stable makes convenient assign macros specific applications It incredibly stable well always detecting program using adjusting I got Business edition Bolt dongle As far I know 8K resolution complete overkill even 3 monitor setup even 4K resolution regular edition overkill Cons:I initially got sync 3 PCs replace MouseWithoutBorders \"Flow\" feature transition PC PC far seamless Sometimes continuously slide mouse edge software pick switch next computer I exaggerating really bad point I manually toggle keyboard mouse Sometimes mouse switches carry keyboard I manually toggle keyboard After tying entire day I went back MouseWithoutBorders learned appreciate stability Warning:1 If already MX Keys better get matching edition share dongle standard keyboard standard mouse vs business business 2 get white version might clean every use rubber finish makes magnet skin cells 3 If get gaming might find bit \"Clunky\" side Then sold gaming mouse With buttons macros great office work like software development Hope helps good ergonomic feel nicely responsive The device extremely easy setup use The clicks quiet smooth enjoyable use The scroll wheel precise fast works ease The device best fit feel mouse feels like personally molded fit hand This excellent mouse But side wheel customization difficult computers And side wheel software could give headache might work But overall I recommend mouse I liked lot long lasts one charge I wish mouse size little bigger Also I wish side buttons lower larger The side wheel feels great But good luck getting give custom commands prefer When \"ratcheting mode\" scroll wheel frequently like 4 5 times gets position scroll forever Apparently poor quality money I absolutely shocked Returned less 48 hours Extremely comfortable hand though app mouse linux system Fits really well hand much less strain mouse came PC I love extra buttons need options currently allowed The left scroll go left right on-screen take-off software another zoom goes in---so kind bummer ---Dear Logitech issue fixed update?Having dedicated copy paste buttons game changer though Otherwise best part quiet clicks - drove batty hear click click clicking noise day long I concerns battery fully charge 100% got 90% plugged night Based first day usage I used 5% battery today So last pretty long charges But I wondering fully charge?Overall nice mouse big improvement basic one need tweaks updates make 5 star worthy imho I love mouse This mouse great deal mice expensive good deal I wanted use work laptop I needed Ergonomics amazing Scroll wheel best one Click sound took time get used The issue I return I able customize mouse My company many others allow download personal software onto work device I use customization mouse If allowed download software I buy immediately It definitely gamer mouse feel use But ergonomic work mouse great I wait get hands mouse hailed many reviewers best productivity mouse PROS• The build quality top-notch The material used feels grippy prevents slipping• The buttons tactile solid Horizontal scroll wheel great addition• Logi Option+ app adds even customisation shortcuts enhance productivity per appCONS• I cannot believe laggy pointer MacOS I tried tweaking pointer speed DPI nothing seems work• I also unable update firmware weird recently released product Same applies MX Keys Mini keyboard• USB A receiver make sense built Mac mind My MacBook Pro 14\" x3 USB C ports means I use adapter Same goes charging Overall I slightly disappointed mouse For $100 mouse laggy $20 mouse I seriously considering returning mouse getting something else choppy pointer impedes productivity All full day use across Windows MacOS bluetooth USB receiver I feel like cons outweighs pros MX Master 3s better though The thing I like much fit handsFor reference I wear size gloves

fact scroll wheel metal least gets rid stepped plastic insert 2S Cleaning part mouse minor quibble 2S nonetheless Either way metal scroll wheel feels lot better use metal actual groves wheel feel much better touch 2 The silent clicks right left clicker positive mind 3 USB-C plus Charging faster although I bother time exact difference 3S 2S Future-proofing good thing given future USB-C4 Bigger horizontal scroll wheel caveat though see con#1 No plastic grippy insert horizonal scroll wheel 3S pro con depending use horizonal scroll wheel I mind either way 2S 3S Cons:1 Logitech moved dedicated side buttons lower placed horizontal scroll wheel dedicated side buttons That means thumb constantly touching lower two buttons left side preference Compared MX Master 2S 3S two side buttons close thumb means I accidentally click default forward button 3S I ever I used MX Master 2S 2 The rubber soft-touch plastic surrounds palm goes way slippery taste The MS Master 2S grippy soft outer rubber layer thumb palm made much easier hold grip Unfortunately MX Master 3S slippery harder grip The MX Master 3S definitely much easier clean holding mouse requires use pinky right ring finger often Compared I used Master MX 3S I could easily swiftly wander 3S using pinky thumb hold right left sides respectively 3 Activation press area hidden thumb button much smaller 3S compared larger area 2S There little grove pit press using thumb 3S much smaller I would like Not smaller 3S position area grove far behind thumb rests I scrunch thumb reach back mouse click annoying The 2S much better placement entire area thumb rest clickable Yes 2S hard plastic edge made harder clean allowed things get made even harder clean since I always clean hands never issue I used 2S hidden thumb button 4 The 3S smaller palm area Depending preference con pro For con I small hands I liked much bulkier MX Master 2S The bulkier 2S easier hold I scrunch palm order make contact palm rest This also means less area palm rest I If rest palm mouse much con Not pro con either:1 No storage area Bolt receiver 3S anywhere like 2S unfortunately I travel lot problem moment I would still liked see tiny

Hero wireless The rubber original M705 mouse worn loose year two use I cut order continue using hyper scroll functionality The G502 rubber probably means loosen time The bad thing MX 3 mouse forward back buttons small cheap plastic buttons difficult press unlike G502 buttons The hump put palm wrest behind thumb wheel overkill bad ergonomics You end hard surface jutting root bone socket index finger The curvature M801P much conducive natural ergonomic flow palm The right left mouse click buttons MX 3 mouse loud put much resistance The right click size narrow allow clicking time without

I trying rotate thumb wheel navigating image gallery This causes gallery start moving based infinite scroll This issue could avoided MX 3 mouse finger channels like G502 Razer Basilisk even M801P

Im obsessed wheel First looks awesome No plastic 100% Machined steel Second scrolls like nothing else Ive ever experienced I leave \"ratchet\" mode time also switch free-spin In ratchet mode flick freespin And Logitech Options software dial like Electromagnets Baby I find flicking wheel sometimes feels nice All buttons fully customizable using Logitech Options software specific functions depending app The downside work computer locked company cant install software I think stuck default functions may enjoyable particular I found default pointer speed way slow This mouse connect computer via bluetooth Logitech Unity USB dongle paired 3 computers toggle using button bottom mouse I ordered mouse \"Graphite\" dark definitely black It would nice offered color darker true \"black \" Still nice looking mouse especially shiny steel scroll wheel The mouse expected positive purchase software never worked properly even latest software update 9 20 374; installed 2021-09-14 The user supposed able assign actions keystrokes buttons installed applications This work I specifically assigned keystrokes buttons apply multiple applications work The mouse far expensive dealing nonsense I written LogiTech received help I used many mice decades This #1 choice I never use another Just spend money already enjoy The mouse great first couple months firmware update mouse cursor sometimes gets stuck 5-10 seconds starts moving Oddly enough happens random days happens extremely annoying deal This first last Logitech mx mouse I ever buy Unacceptable I already way past refund window SOL I already googled various \"fixes\" websites suggested watched enough youtube videos tried I confidently confirm THERE IS NO FIX I totally wrong The Logitech MX Master 3 best mouse I ever used comfortable cursor movement excellent especially Photoshop users What difference MX MASTER 3 model 910-005647 MX MASTER 3 model 910-005620? cool good I liked mouse return It comfortable hand I like fact DPI switcher pinky would drag side light weight wise Otherwise scrolling button clicking awesome It worked great like photoshop editing I jumped game I felt drawback This worst quality mouse I ever used After 10 months wheel loss ratchet function go freely I already change setting setting working Send replacement $100 expensive computer mouse But damn device worth every penny The attention detail Logitech engineers product designers evident every piece mouse The overall design excellent thing comfortable mouse I ever used Every button easily accessible position Everything customizable surprisingly slick piece software runs equally well macbook windows desktop The entire user experience considered tuned system level easy thing product design The scroll wheel awesome There nothing else like market knowledge It ratchets want scrolls hundreds lines smoothly flick It controlled actively clever electromagnetic mechanism flip ratchet It taking advantage magnetic hysteresis alter field produced magnetic core interacts toothed steel scroll wheel depending polarity last current spike It works lot like magnetic core memory really old computers store flip states Very cool I hope engineer came got raise The side scroll wheel useful mechanically damped premium feel The forward back buttons tactile click modifier button beneath thumb allows program range extra functions gestures nice touch Overall go wrong thing I recommend buying want It hard use anything else using days I think mouse excellent really good features However graphic designer I think gestures Apple Magic Mouse much convenient Would recommend anyone except designers The scrolling issue kills product I purchased 6 month ago heavily use daily basis since This mouse decides zoom scroll pages I personally giving Battery dies little instruction But charges fine using supplied cord Comfortable I high expectations mouse given high price point Logitech reputation However even 3rd iteration Logitech failed put together decent scroll wheel They market magnetic scroll wheel upgrade I use scroll wheel $10 mouse day week The mouse two options regular scroll infinite scroll Regular scroll register scroll half time unreliable Infinite scroll works much better regular scroll infinite scroll I feel scroll wheel loosen shift around whenever I move mouse left right This extremely annoying When using good mouse forget even using It feel like extension hand Instead MX Master 3 let forget using subpar product Pretty disappointed issues like persist flagship productivity mouse I fan G915 keyboard G602 mouse MX Master 3 falls way behind mark I disappointed fan products This best investment I made increasing productivity I highly recommend turning almost buttons gesture buttons add extra 4 custom commands The mouse feels amazing use definitely improves experience using computer I would say primarily power user wants good ergonomics lots buttons lots customization Logitech delivers fronts First ergonomics quite good Sorry right-handed It mouse comfortable use button placement on-point The side-wheel side-buttons gesture button easily accessible thumb without make awkward reaches The left right-buttons middle-buttons similarly easy access pointer middle finger The button wheel feel great The middle-wheel amazing This mouse around good feel comfortable also feels like using quality tool No complaints There options connectivity You connect using included Unifying receiver preference Or connect via Bluetooth computer Bluetooth adapter Or connect using included USB-A USB-C charge cable About charge cable yes mouse rechargeable batteries sealed inside I get 3 months light medium usage charges It good ~2 years AA powered mouse get days However mouse work charging never get caught without batteries on-hand Also big kudos Logitech making charging port USB-C Customizations lacking For button except left right swap plenty choices Logitech Options software Also controllable standard things like scroll speed direction wheels pointer speed smoothness The middle-wheel probably one main \"physical\" attractions mouse According Logitech floats magnets It configured spin freely I mean freely It extremely smooth negligible resistance continues spin long long time flick wheel Or configured traditional ratchet feel Or configured combination ratchets go slowly spins freely give quick flick The middle-wheel really really good Button customizations point scroll customizations split two categories global application specific This means customizations general system also customizations specific applications For example wanted scroll speed slower working Acrobat faster working Chrome browser set customizations mouse automatically behave accordingly working applications This basic example actually full set button assignments well point scroll options application You get creative really customize mouse work You even configure middle-wheel click one application spin freely another application This level customization truly fantastic sets mouse apart THE choice professionals work pro software applications living This mouse ability pair three computers On bottom mouse button allows manually toggle 1 2 & 3 However Logitech Options allows take step If mouse paired computers computer Options installed setup feature called Flow Flow allows drag mouse edge screen automatically connect computer The cursor moves screen computer Since I also using MX Keys keyboard also transfers computer Part Flow ability file share computers requires Wi-Fi Ethernet network There options multi-device mouse seamless way mouse switch devices Unfortunately like using Flow turn mouse click button switch devices My one complaint mouse customizations I seem program mouse button lock screen I click There ways lock screen preference click middle-wheel It biggie seems like oversight available customizations I still highly recommend mouse power users professionals work pro software applications This far best mouse I ever owned It bit costly worth every penny Scrolling mac machines little wonky - I document fast scroll page- move another document - finish scrolling document - tried different speeds - like mac mouse scrolling perfect - rough feeling make sure I stopped scrolling one doc- work anotherVery large work with- comfortable - I like way - bad A good upgrade prior version I fairly small hand I found mouse bit big I also like rubberize mice I find hand gets bit hot sticky I wish hard cool plastic After seeing mouse used multiple video editors I finally bit bullet got one And I regrets This thing smooth scrolling smooth side buttons nice It works comfortable Gesture button keeps forgetting setting go back This expensive mouse supposed I missed return window 2 days Don like Don buy mouse mac care gestures like mission control switching desktop spaces Perfect fit big hand Aside old Kensington 12-button trackball favorite mouse trackball device I work video game audio development spend long hours across multiple computers using software running macOS Windows This mouse let way Over past year many hours per day mouse negatively affect wrist many others I find comfortable The battery life great I get 4-6 weeks needing charge I need plug I continue use since port front I wish port mouse micro USB deal-breaker I high expectations multi-computer features experience actually works useful I need I one small issue mouse would pass Mac secondary monitor Windows laptop would return Windows macOS After issue disappeared reboots every

negates usefulness device switching feature bit But huge deal The shape bit weird first week I come really like I wish forward back thumb buttons mouse bit bigger Also sometimes takes 2-3 seconds wake

browser tabs The mouse able used various surfaces even without mouse pad I happy purchase This mouse nice contoured shape right-handed users I cannot imagine using left-handed however There textured rubber encasing mouse took couple days adapt I I enjoy using mouse enjoy functionality scroll wheel left side mouse My biggest concern however mouse rubberized texture eventually become sticky unusable rubberized devices I years Logitech Mice well indication This texture covers good 75% mouse top surface This mouse amazingly comfortable many useful features The scroll wheel side amazing

things configured mouse makes painful use I carpal tunnel size mouse conjunction way buttons spaced uncomfortable I gave three stars little bit I able use I love I wished hurt much This mouse amazingly smooth use quiet buttons Pros:1 The fact scroll wheel metal least gets rid stepped plastic insert 2S Cleaning part mouse minor quibble 2S nonetheless Either way metal scroll wheel feels lot better use metal actual groves wheel feel much better touch 2 The silent clicks right left clicker positive mind 3 USB-C plus Charging faster although I bother time exact difference 3S 2S Future-proofing good thing given future USB-C4 Bigger horizontal scroll wheel caveat though see con#1 No plastic grippy insert horizonal scroll wheel 3S pro con depending use horizonal scroll wheel I mind either way 2S 3S Cons:1 Logitech moved dedicated side buttons lower placed horizontal scroll wheel dedicated side buttons That means thumb constantly touching lower two buttons left side preference Compared MX Master 2S 3S two side buttons close thumb means I accidentally click default forward button 3S I ever I used MX Master 2S 2 The rubber soft-touch plastic surrounds palm goes way slippery taste The MS Master 2S grippy soft outer rubber layer thumb palm made much easier hold grip Unfortunately MX Master 3S slippery harder grip The MX Master 3S definitely much easier clean holding mouse requires use pinky right ring finger often Compared I used Master MX 3S I could easily swiftly wander 3S using pinky thumb hold right left sides respectively 3 Activation press area hidden thumb button much smaller 3S compared larger area 2S There little grove pit press using thumb 3S much smaller I would like Not smaller 3S position area grove far behind thumb rests I scrunch thumb reach back mouse click annoying The 2S much better placement entire area thumb rest clickable Yes 2S hard plastic edge made harder clean allowed things get made even harder clean since I always clean hands never issue I used 2S hidden thumb button 4 The 3S smaller palm area Depending preference con pro For con I small hands I liked much bulkier MX Master 2S The bulkier 2S easier hold I scrunch palm order make contact palm rest This also means less area palm rest I If rest palm mouse much con Not pro con either:1 No storage area Bolt receiver 3S anywhere like 2S unfortunately I travel lot problem moment I would still liked see tiny compartment place Bolt receiver use One old Logitech wireless mouse removable battery compartment allowed place receiver use great Now I lost receivers place put tiny Unifying receivers 2 No visible charge level indicator Yes charging indicator tell battery level percentage without check software The green light simply I know looks like low

Hero wireless The rubber original M705 mouse worn loose year two use I cut order continue using hyper scroll functionality The G502 rubber probably means loosen time The bad thing MX 3 mouse forward back buttons small cheap plastic buttons difficult press unlike G502 buttons The hump put palm wrest behind thumb wheel overkill bad ergonomics You end hard surface jutting root bone socket index finger The curvature M801P much conducive natural ergonomic flow palm The right left mouse click buttons MX 3 mouse loud put much resistance The right click size narrow allow clicking time without

I trying rotate thumb wheel navigating image gallery This causes gallery start moving based infinite scroll This issue could avoided MX 3 mouse finger channels like G502 Razer Basilisk even M801P

Very Frustrating This big mice This makes conventional mice feel like toys The ability switch wheel ratchet mode free spin great It also tracks better mouse I used For price I somewhat disappointed I still Logic G13 every single button programmed used I G710+ every programmable button programmed used There capability mouse Of companies Logitec know customers want capability I would suspect customers want program thumb buttons wheel out-number customers want use mouse automatically 2 computers 10 1 So relatively useless feature helpful one This fixed I hope wake issue You get great mouse Logitec smart I love feel mouse I wish I purchased long ago I subtracted one star rating battery life bit short Also I starting Excel issues installing mouse responsive especially saving file It pretty good mouse especially ability modify buttons Logitech app installed It quite heavy though good folks like heavier mouses I think gamers like heavier mouses Hate feel mouse MX Master 2 much better mouse Skip garbage get previous gen mouse Plug play optional presets popular apps Overall great mouse super comfortable use hours The negative I found price You buy good mouse less I two days; even customized yet Seems super mouse; easy use I like especially require lot color variation pad; fact require pad Main reason I writing make clear might obvious Both mouse MX Keys come dongle Neither dongle works devices Windows 10 computer accept two dongles This stumped till I accepted I could connect one device wireless bluetooth An Amazon chat person considerable chatting waits get expert help finally suggest I wasted bit time trying find one-dongle-for-both solution You use three-connection option devices In fact I using bluetooth connect far two hours works perfectly So may obvious many folks proficient I low bar I figured worth post make clear Works really well hand Software pretty slick It high quality stuff expect Logitech nowadays Having customized application settings via Logitech options nice feature Being able Mute Zoom Teams calls back button makes easier control presence call The automatic adjusting scroll wheel great add feature coming Logitech mice The media could loaded I used love mouse year stutters every seconds making nearly unusable Extremely disappointed I purchased mouse professional use; seeing pictures Reddit reading tons positive reviews I using gaming-style mice previously This mouse looks professional designed power users My use case primarily Solidworks Adobe Acrobat MS excel & word Microsoft Dynamics GP; front computer 6-8 hours day typically I want mouse comfortable efficient Ergonomically I find mouse fairly comfortable perfect I Smedium hand size mouse grip something claw palm grip My pinky bit uncomfortable far I still getting adjusted new mouse I found thumb reaching far back high \"back\" button think matter getting used mouse The gesture button thumb rest bit tricky awkward click I dont think I really use gesture feature programmed button toggle scroll wheel ratchet freespin mode The mouse nice rubberized texture Im sure wear time see It good weight feels solid people may prefer lighterweight mice The buttons nice clicky good tactile audible feedback 7 total buttons It two primary mouse buttons scroll wheel clicked small button directly behind scroll wheel two buttons side mouse forward back button bottom edge thumb rest Alright talk main scroll wheel now? Im obsessed wheel First looks awesome No plastic 100% Machined steel Second scrolls like nothing else Ive ever experienced I leave \"ratchet\" mode time also switch free-spin In ratchet mode flick freespin And Logitech Options software dial like Electromagnets Baby I find flicking wheel sometimes feels nice All buttons fully customizable using Logitech Options software specific functions depending app The downside work computer locked company cant install software I think stuck default functions may enjoyable particular I found default pointer speed way slow This mouse connect computer via bluetooth Logitech Unity USB dongle paired 3 computers toggle using button bottom mouse I ordered mouse \"Graphite\" dark definitely black It would nice offered color darker true \"black \" Still nice looking mouse especially shiny steel scroll wheel The mouse expected positive purchase software never worked properly even latest software update 9 20 374; installed 2021-09-14 The user supposed able assign actions keystrokes buttons installed applications This work I specifically assigned keystrokes buttons apply multiple applications work The mouse far expensive dealing nonsense I written LogiTech received help I used many mice decades This #1 choice I never use another Just spend money already enjoy The mouse great first couple months firmware update mouse cursor sometimes gets stuck 5-10 seconds starts moving Oddly enough happens random days happens extremely annoying deal This first last Logitech mx mouse I ever buy Unacceptable I already way past refund window SOL I already googled various \"fixes\" websites suggested watched enough youtube videos tried I confidently confirm THERE IS NO FIX I totally wrong The Logitech MX Master 3 best mouse I ever used comfortable cursor movement excellent especially Photoshop users What difference MX MASTER 3 model 910-005647 MX MASTER 3 model 910-005620? cool good I liked mouse return It comfortable hand I like fact DPI switcher pinky would drag side light weight wise Otherwise scrolling button clicking awesome It worked great like photoshop editing I jumped game I felt drawback This worst quality mouse I ever used After 10 months wheel loss ratchet function go freely I already change setting setting working Send replacement $100 expensive computer mouse But damn device worth every penny The attention detail Logitech engineers product designers evident every piece mouse The overall design excellent thing comfortable mouse I ever used Every button easily accessible position Everything customizable surprisingly slick piece software runs equally well macbook windows desktop The entire user experience considered tuned system level easy thing product design The scroll wheel awesome There nothing else like market knowledge It ratchets want scrolls hundreds lines smoothly flick It controlled actively clever electromagnetic mechanism flip ratchet It taking advantage magnetic hysteresis alter field produced magnetic core interacts toothed steel scroll wheel depending polarity last current spike It works lot like magnetic core memory really old computers store flip states Very cool I hope engineer came got raise The side scroll wheel useful mechanically damped premium feel The forward back buttons tactile click modifier button beneath thumb allows program range extra functions gestures nice touch Overall go wrong thing I recommend buying want It hard use anything else using days I think mouse excellent really good features However graphic designer I think gestures Apple Magic Mouse much convenient Would recommend anyone except designers The scrolling issue kills product I purchased 6 month ago heavily use daily basis since This mouse decides zoom scroll pages I personally giving Battery dies little instruction But charges fine using supplied cord Comfortable I high expectations mouse given high price point Logitech reputation However even 3rd iteration Logitech failed put together decent scroll wheel They market magnetic scroll wheel upgrade I use scroll wheel $10 mouse day week The mouse two options regular scroll infinite scroll Regular scroll register scroll half time unreliable Infinite scroll works much better regular scroll infinite scroll I feel scroll wheel loosen shift around whenever I move mouse left right This extremely annoying When using good mouse forget even using It feel like extension hand Instead MX Master 3 let forget using subpar product Pretty disappointed issues like persist flagship productivity mouse I fan G915 keyboard G602 mouse MX Master 3 falls way behind mark I disappointed fan products This best investment I made increasing productivity I highly recommend turning almost buttons gesture buttons add extra 4 custom commands The mouse feels amazing use definitely improves experience using computer I would say primarily power user wants good ergonomics lots buttons lots customization Logitech delivers fronts First ergonomics quite good Sorry right-handed It mouse comfortable use button placement on-point The side-wheel side-buttons gesture button easily accessible thumb without make awkward reaches The left right-buttons middle-buttons similarly easy access pointer middle finger The button wheel feel great The middle-wheel amazing This mouse around good feel comfortable also feels like using quality tool No complaints There options connectivity You connect using included Unifying receiver preference Or connect via Bluetooth computer Bluetooth adapter Or connect using included USB-A USB-C charge cable About charge cable yes mouse rechargeable batteries sealed inside I get 3 months light medium usage charges It good ~2 years AA powered mouse get days However mouse work charging never get caught without batteries on-hand Also big kudos Logitech making charging port USB-C Customizations lacking For button except left right swap plenty choices Logitech Options software Also controllable standard things like scroll speed direction wheels pointer speed smoothness The middle-wheel probably one main \"physical\" attractions mouse According Logitech floats magnets It configured spin freely I mean freely It extremely smooth negligible resistance continues spin long long time flick wheel Or configured traditional ratchet feel Or configured combination ratchets go slowly spins freely give quick flick The middle-wheel really really good Button customizations point scroll customizations split two categories global application specific This means customizations general system also customizations specific applications For example wanted scroll speed slower working Acrobat faster working Chrome browser set customizations mouse automatically behave accordingly working applications This basic example actually full set button assignments well point scroll options application You get creative really customize mouse work You even configure middle-wheel click one application spin freely another application This level customization truly fantastic sets mouse apart THE choice professionals work pro software applications living This mouse ability pair three computers On bottom mouse button allows manually toggle 1 2 & 3 However Logitech Options allows take step If mouse paired computers computer Options installed setup feature called Flow Flow allows drag mouse edge screen automatically connect computer The cursor moves screen computer Since I also using MX Keys keyboard also transfers computer Part Flow ability file share computers requires Wi-Fi Ethernet network There options multi-device mouse seamless way mouse switch devices Unfortunately like using Flow turn mouse click button switch devices My one complaint mouse customizations I seem program mouse button lock screen I click There ways lock screen preference click middle-wheel It biggie seems like oversight available customizations I still highly recommend mouse power users professionals work pro software applications This far best mouse I ever owned It bit costly worth every penny Scrolling mac machines little wonky - I document fast scroll page- move another document - finish scrolling document - tried different speeds - like mac mouse scrolling perfect - rough feeling make sure I stopped scrolling one doc- work anotherVery large work with- comfortable - I like way - bad A good upgrade prior version I fairly small hand I found mouse bit big I also like rubberize mice I find hand gets bit hot sticky I wish hard cool plastic After seeing mouse used multiple video editors I finally bit bullet got one And I regrets This thing smooth scrolling smooth side buttons nice It works comfortable Gesture button keeps forgetting setting go back This expensive mouse supposed I missed return window 2 days Don like Don buy mouse mac care gestures like mission control switching desktop spaces Perfect fit big hand Aside old Kensington 12-button trackball favorite mouse trackball device I work video game audio development spend long hours across multiple computers using software running macOS Windows This mouse let way Over past year many hours per day mouse negatively affect wrist many others I find comfortable The battery life great I get 4-6 weeks needing charge I need plug I continue use since port front I wish port mouse micro USB deal-breaker I high expectations

negates usefulness device switching feature bit But huge deal The shape bit weird first week I come really like I wish forward back thumb buttons mouse bit bigger Also sometimes takes 2-3 seconds wake
