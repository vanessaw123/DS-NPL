Like anyone, keeping first two fingers left right buttons, hold mouse move thumb left third finger right. The Problem: My third finger getting sore naturally rested mouse sharper edge, rounded contour completely fades turns defined edge right third finger grabs it. Logitech, pay design engineers way much money think simple things.. Just keep smooth rounded contour continuing entire right side full length mouse, simple! Also defined (not smooth) edge exists back mouse. Why continue curve rest way bottom even 1/8 bottom center lower palm support too? Why flare high sharper edge presses user's palm? This can't save much weight mouse stop high desk surface.

With MX 3S taller rolls steeply sides.. causing hand supported high point/middle lift hand move mouse, really lose even support. Result: Very little support, resulting fatigue several hours use -- fatigue finger tip third finger gets sore, mentioned above, also overall arching hand makes wrist curve upward mouse instead remaining straight/flat forward like G602 604.

The fact scroll wheel metal least gets rid stepped plastic insert 2S.Cleaning part mouse minor quibble 2S nonetheless.

USB-C plus.Charging faster although I bother time exact difference 3S 2S. Future-proofing good thing given future USB-C4.) Bigger horizontal scroll wheel caveat though (see con#1).No plastic grippy insert horizonal scroll wheel 3S pro con depending use horizonal scroll wheel. I mind either way 2S 3S me.Cons:1.) Logitech moved dedicated side buttons lower placed horizontal scroll wheel dedicated side buttons.That means thumb constantly touching lower two buttons left side preference. Compared MX Master 2S, 3S two side buttons close thumb means I accidentally click (default) forward button 3S I ever I used MX Master 2S.2.) The rubber soft-touch plastic surrounds palm goes way slippery taste.The MS Master 2S grippy soft outer rubber layer thumb palm made much easier hold grip. Unfortunately MX Master 3S slippery harder grip. The MX Master 3S definitely much easier clean holding mouse requires use pinky right ring finger often. Compared I used Master MX 3S, I could easily swiftly wander 3S using pinky thumb hold right left sides respectively.3.) Activation/press area hidden thumb button much smaller 3S compared larger area 2S.There's little grove/pit press using thumb 3S much smaller I would like. Not smaller 3S, position area/grove far behind thumb rests. I scrunch thumb reach back mouse click annoying. The 2S much better placement entire area thumb rest clickable. Yes, 2S hard plastic edge made harder clean allowed things get made even harder clean since I always clean hands never issue I used 2S hidden thumb button.4.) The 3S smaller palm area.Depending preference, con pro both. For me, con. I small hands I liked much bulkier MX Master 2S was. The bulkier 2S easier hold I scrunch palm order make contact palm rest. This also means less area palm rest I do. If rest palm mouse much, con you.Not pro con either:1.) No storage area Bolt receiver 3S anywhere like 2S unfortunately.I travel lot problem moment I would still liked see tiny compartment place Bolt receiver use. One old Logitech wireless mouse removable battery compartment allowed place receiver use great. Now I lost receivers there's place put tiny Unifying receivers.2.) No visible charge level indicator.Yes charging indicator tell battery level/percentage without check software. The green light simply off. I know looks like low battery (like turns red anything) I'd rather know actual percentage glancing mouse instead open software constantly check. For example, three tiny lights tell battery high, medium, low. Notifying IS low battery literally waiting last minute let know I charge plus exactly.3.) Ambidextrous not.I'm left handed ambidextrous I really would liked seen ambidextrous version MX Master series Logitech.4.) You use even charging (looking Apple Sony).I hate able use devices they're charging especially I like plus devices let charge (and overcharge) overnight. I'm glad Logitech try reinvent wheel look sleeker dumber like Apple's pathetic (not so) Magic mouse.5.) No USB-C receiver.I switch desktop using Windows MacBook Air.

Every time want change computers, pick mouse push button. How stupid that! Okay, able customize buttons let’s assign function one to, right? Nope, can’t it. This definitely needs fixed – Logitech that’s bonehead. In 3 months using it, I problems connectivity.Quality/Durability:So far good.

Logitech delivers fronts.First off, ergonomics quite good (Sorry, right-handed only). It's mouse comfortable use, button placement on-point. The side-wheel, side-buttons, gesture button easily accessible thumb, without make awkward reaches. The left/right-buttons, middle-buttons similarly easy access pointer middle finger. The button wheel feel great. The middle-wheel amazing. This mouse around good feel, comfortable, also feels like using quality tool. No complaints.There options connectivity. You connect using included Unifying receiver (my preference). Or connect via Bluetooth, computer Bluetooth adapter. Or connect using included USB-A USB-C charge cable. About charge cable, yes, mouse rechargeable batteries sealed inside. I get 3 months light medium usage charges. It's good ~2 years AA powered mouse get days. However, mouse work charging, never get caught without batteries on-hand. Also, big kudos Logitech making charging port USB-C.Customizations lacking. For button, except left right (which swap), plenty choices Logitech Options software. Also controllable standard things like scroll speed/direction (for wheels), pointer speed, smoothness. The middle-wheel probably one main \"\"physical\"\" attractions mouse. According Logitech floats magnets. It configured spin freely, I mean freely. It's extremely smooth, negligible resistance, continues spin long, long time flick wheel. Or configured traditional ratchet feel. Or configured combination, ratchets go slowly, spins freely give quick flick. The middle-wheel really, really good.Button customizations point/scroll customizations split two categories, global application specific. This means customizations general system, also customizations specific applications. For example, wanted scroll speed slower working Acrobat, faster working Chrome browser, set customizations mouse automatically behave accordingly working applications. This basic example, actually full set button assignments, well point scroll options application. You get creative really customize mouse work you. You even configure middle-wheel click one application, spin freely another application. This level customization truly fantastic, sets mouse apart THE choice professionals work pro software applications living.This mouse ability pair three computers. On bottom mouse button allows manually toggle 1, 2, & 3. However, Logitech Options allows take step further. If mouse paired computers, computer Options installed, setup feature called Flow. Flow allows drag mouse edge screen, automatically connect computer. The cursor moves screen computer. Since I'm also using MX Keys keyboard, also transfers computer. Part Flow ability file share computers (requires Wi-Fi Ethernet network). There options multi-device mouse, seamless way mouse switch devices. Unfortunately, like using Flow, turn mouse click button switch devices.My one complaint mouse customizations, I can't seem program mouse button lock screen I click it. There's ways lock screen, preference click middle-wheel. It's biggie, seems like oversight available customizations.

Like anyone, keeping first two fingers left right buttons, hold mouse move thumb left third finger right.

Logitech, pay design engineers way much money think simple things.. Just keep smooth rounded contour continuing entire right side full length mouse, simple! Also defined (not smooth) edge exists back mouse. Why continue curve rest way bottom even 1/8 bottom center lower palm support too? Why flare high sharper edge presses user's palm?

The fact scroll wheel metal least gets rid stepped plastic insert 2S.Cleaning part mouse minor quibble 2S nonetheless.

USB-C plus.Charging faster although I bother time exact difference 3S 2S. Future-proofing good thing given future USB-C4.) Bigger horizontal scroll wheel caveat though (see con#1).No plastic grippy insert horizonal scroll wheel 3S pro con depending use horizonal scroll wheel. I mind either way 2S 3S me.Cons:1.) Logitech moved dedicated side buttons lower placed horizontal scroll wheel dedicated side buttons.That means thumb constantly touching lower two buttons left side preference. Compared MX Master 2S, 3S two side buttons close thumb means I accidentally click (default) forward button 3S I ever I used MX Master 2S.2.) The rubber soft-touch plastic surrounds palm goes way slippery taste.The MS Master 2S grippy soft outer rubber layer thumb palm made much easier hold grip. Unfortunately MX Master 3S slippery harder grip. The MX Master 3S definitely much easier clean holding mouse requires use pinky right ring finger often. Compared I used Master MX 3S, I could easily swiftly wander 3S using pinky thumb hold right left sides respectively.3.) Activation/press area hidden thumb button much smaller 3S compared larger area 2S.There's little grove/pit press using thumb 3S much smaller I would like. Not smaller 3S, position area/grove far behind thumb rests. I scrunch thumb reach back mouse click annoying. The 2S much better placement entire area thumb rest clickable. Yes, 2S hard plastic edge made harder clean allowed things get made even harder clean since I always clean hands never issue I used 2S hidden thumb button.4.) The 3S smaller palm area.Depending preference, con pro both. For me, con. I small hands I liked much bulkier MX Master 2S was. The bulkier 2S easier hold I scrunch palm order make contact palm rest. This also means less area palm rest I do. If rest palm mouse much, con you.Not pro con either:1.) No storage area Bolt receiver 3S anywhere like 2S unfortunately.I travel lot problem moment I would still liked see tiny compartment place Bolt receiver use. One old Logitech wireless mouse removable battery compartment allowed place receiver use great. Now I lost receivers there's place put tiny Unifying receivers.2.) No visible charge level indicator.Yes charging indicator tell battery level/percentage without check software. The green light simply off. I know looks like low battery (like turns red anything) I'd rather know actual percentage glancing mouse instead open software constantly check. For example, three tiny lights tell battery high, medium, low. Notifying IS low battery literally waiting last minute let know I charge plus exactly.3.) Ambidextrous not.I'm left handed ambidextrous I really would liked seen ambidextrous version MX Master series Logitech.4.) You use even charging (looking Apple Sony).I hate able use devices they're charging especially I like plus devices let charge (and overcharge) overnight. I'm glad Logitech try reinvent wheel look sleeker dumber like Apple's pathetic (not so) Magic mouse.5.) No USB-C receiver.I switch desktop using Windows MacBook Air. The Windows desktop uses Bolt receiver MacBook Air uses Bluetooth. The Bluetooth use 3S mouse little laggy MacBook Air I mind much since I code hobby. My Windows desktop main computer. I Bolt receiver MacBook Air yet that's I'm a.) waiting see Logitech gives us Bolt receiver USB-C b.) I docking station/hub yet use MacBook Air anyway (and MacBook Air I USB-C ports).

Logitech delivers fronts.First off, ergonomics quite good (Sorry, right-handed only). It's mouse comfortable use, button placement on-point. The side-wheel, side-buttons, gesture button easily accessible thumb, without make awkward reaches. The left/right-buttons, middle-buttons similarly easy access pointer middle finger. The button wheel feel great. The middle-wheel amazing. This mouse around good feel, comfortable, also feels like using quality tool. No complaints.There options connectivity. You connect using included Unifying receiver (my preference). Or connect via Bluetooth, computer Bluetooth adapter. Or connect using included USB-A USB-C charge cable. About charge cable, yes, mouse rechargeable batteries sealed inside. I get 3 months light medium usage charges. It's good ~2 years AA powered mouse get days. However, mouse work charging, never get caught without batteries on-hand. Also, big kudos Logitech making charging port USB-C.Customizations lacking. For button, except left right (which swap), plenty choices Logitech Options software. Also controllable standard things like scroll speed/direction (for wheels), pointer speed, smoothness. The middle-wheel probably one main \"\"physical\"\" attractions mouse. According Logitech floats magnets. It configured spin freely, I mean freely. It's extremely smooth, negligible resistance, continues spin long, long time flick wheel. Or configured traditional ratchet feel. Or configured combination, ratchets go slowly, spins freely give quick flick. The middle-wheel really, really good.Button customizations point/scroll customizations split two categories, global application specific. This means customizations general system, also customizations specific applications. For example, wanted scroll speed slower working Acrobat, faster working Chrome browser, set customizations mouse automatically behave accordingly working applications. This basic example, actually full set button assignments, well point scroll options application. You get creative really customize mouse work you. You even configure middle-wheel click one application, spin freely another application. This level customization truly fantastic, sets mouse apart THE choice professionals work pro software applications living.This mouse ability pair three computers. On bottom mouse button allows manually toggle 1, 2, & 3. However, Logitech Options allows take step further. If mouse paired computers, computer Options installed, setup feature called Flow. Flow allows drag mouse edge screen, automatically connect computer. The cursor moves screen computer. Since I'm also using MX Keys keyboard, also transfers computer. Part Flow ability file share computers (requires Wi-Fi Ethernet network). There options multi-device mouse, seamless way mouse switch devices. Unfortunately, like using Flow, turn mouse click button switch devices.My one complaint mouse customizations, I can't seem program mouse button lock screen I click it. There's ways lock screen, preference click middle-wheel. It's biggie, seems like oversight available customizations.
